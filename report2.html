            <p id="psh"><b>Blood banks waste 2.8 million units in 5 years</b> <sub><em>Apr 24, 2017</em></sub></p>
            <p class="content">MUMBAI: In the last five years, over 2.8 million precious units of blood and its components were discarded by blood banks across the country+ , exposing serious loopholes in the nation’s blood banking system. The cumulative wastage of around 6%, if calculated in litres, is more than 6 lakh litres—a volume enough to fill up 53 water tankers.
                States like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu were among the worst offenders, discarding not just whole blood but even life-saving components such as red blood cells and plasma as the life-saving products could not be used before the end of their shelf life.</p>
            <p class="content">In 2016-17 alone, over 6.57 lakh units of blood and its products were discarded. The worrying part is that 50% of the wasted units was plasma that has a longer shelf life of one year as compared to whole blood and red blood cells that have to be used within 35 days.</p>
            <p class="content">Maharashtra, which is the only state to have crossed the one million mark in blood collection, also topped the dubious list with maximum wastage of whole blood followed by West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. Maharashtra, UP and Karnataka bagged the top three positions in discarding the highest units of red blood cells. UP and Karnataka wasted the maximum units of fresh frozen plasma. In 2016-17, over 3 lakh units of fresh frozen plasma was discarded, which is ironic given that the product is imported by several pharma companies to produce albumin.</p>
            <p class="content">The figures are alarming because blood shortage is a chronic problem in our country. It exists everywhere, right from the most interior parts of the country to metros like Delhi and Mumbai. Delhi alone faces an annual shortage of 1lakh units
                <br>India has an annual shortfall of 3 million units of blood. Lack of blood, plasma or platelets often becomes the cause for maternal mortality and deaths in accident cases.
                <br>A single unit of whole blood can be broken into components such as red blood cells, plasma and platelet. However, most government-owned blood banks don’t have fractionalization facility that can process the blood and break it into components.

            </p>
            <p class="content"><b>FACTS</b>
                <ul class="points">
                    <li>The blood type most often requested by hospitals is Type O.</li>
                    <li>Sickle cell patients can require frequent blood transfusions throughout their lives.</li>
                    <li>More than 1 million new people are diagnosed with cancer each year. Many of them will need blood, sometimes daily, during their chemotherapy treatment.</li>
                    <li>A single car accident victim can require as many as 100 units of blood</li>
                    <li>Blood cannot be manufactured – it can only come from generous donors.</li>
                    <li>Type O-negative blood (red cells) can be transfused to patients of all blood types. It is always in great demand and often in short supply.</li>
                    <li>Type AB-positive plasma can be transfused to patients of all other blood types. AB plasma is also usually in short supply.</li>
                    <li>Only 7 percent of people in India have O-negative blood type. O-negative blood type donors are universal donors as their blood can be given to people of all blood types.</li>
                    <li>O negative is the first blood supply to run out during a shortage due to its universality.</li>
                    <li>Only 7% of the population have O negative  blood. Due to the its versatility for transfusions, it is in high demand.  In an emergency, it is the blood product of choice. For example, just one car accident victim can require up to 100 units of O neg. Meeting the demand for O negative blood is always a priority for the Red Cross. </li>
                    <li>O positive red blood cells are not universally compatible to all types, but they are compatible to any red blood cells that are positive (A+, B+, O+, AB+).
                        <br><b class="arrow">=></b>Over 80% of the population has a positive blood type and can receive O positive blood. 
                        <br><b class="arrow">=></b>Type O positive blood is given to patients more than any other blood type, which is why it’s considered the most needed blood type.
                        <br><b class="arrow">=></b>38% of the population has O positive blood, making it the most common blood type.
                        <br><b class="arrow">=></b>In major traumas with massive blood loss, many hospitals transfuse O positive blood, even when the patient’s blood type is unknown. The risk of reaction is much lower in ongoing blood loss situations and O positive is more available than O negative. Type O positive blood is critical in trauma care.
                        <br><b class="arrow">=></b>Type O positive blood is one of the first to run out during a shortage due to its high demand.

            <p class="content"><b>IMPORTANCE OF BLOOD DONATION...</b>
                <ul class="points">
                    <li>One donation can help save the lives of up to three people.</li>
                    <li>If you began donating blood at age 18 and donated every 90 days until you reached 60, you would have donated 30 gallons of blood, potentially helping save more than 500 lives!</li>
                    <li>0.4 percent of people have AB-blood type. AB-type blood donors are universal donors of plasma, which is often used in emergencies, for newborns and for patients requiring massive transfusions.</li>
                    <li>Thirty-five percent of people have Type O (positive or negative) blood.</li>
                    <li>Every year our nation requires about 5 Crore units of blood, out of which only a meager 2.5 Crore units of blood are available.</li>
                    <li>The gift of blood is the gift of life. There is no substitute for human blood.</li>
                    <li>More than 38,000 blood donations are needed every day.</li>
